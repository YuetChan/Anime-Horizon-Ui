    <p>In the night, Nameless Nie allowed the snow to land on his body without care as he gradually disappeared from sight.</p><p>Patriarch Nie and Madam Nie stared at each other, speechless.</p><p>Several days passed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Old Ji, why did you call me?” Nameless Nie asked into the phone.</p><p>“I received news that the Arbitration Council is about to take action against Ling Miao,” Ji Xiuran said.</p><p>Nameless Nie furrowed his brows. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I don’t know the situation yet. Keep a closer eye on things.”</p><p><br></p><p>After the call ended, Nameless Nie fell into contemplation.</p><p>Could it be because of that ring?</p><p>Ling Miao’s ring symbolized the most supreme power in the Rose of Death.</p><p>Nameless Nie even crafted a nearly identical lovers ring using it as a model.</p><p><br></p><p>…</p><p>High in the mountain, a woman was at her last gasp.</p><p>“Isn’t Nameless Nie here?” Ling Miao surveyed her surroundings.</p><p class="ql-align-center"><br></p><p>So the President of the Martial Arts Union deceived her? He used Nameless Nie’s life as bait only to trick her here.</p><p>Things would be okay as long as he was fine…</p><p>“Aunt!”</p><p><br></p><p>Worriless Nie didn’t know what to do as she watched Ling Miao.</p><p>“Here…”</p><p>Ling Miao used her last trace of energy to hand her ring to the girl.</p><p>“Don’t… let other people see it… Help me… watch over your brother…”</p><p>…</p><p>It was several days later before Nameless Nie found out Ling Miao encountered a mishap.</p><p>This was a strike of lightning for Nameless Nie.</p><p>He lost track of the number of times he got absolutely smashed. He didn’t know whether it was a dream or reality.</p><p><br></p><p>He couldn’t even protect his own woman.</p><p>Even more, he wasn’t by her side when she needed him the most.</p><p>Just how lonely and hopeless had she felt?</p><p>The Independent State…</p><p>The Arbitration Council…</p><p>The Martial Arts Union!</p><p>None of them would be spared! They all had to perish!!!</p><p>…</p><p>Nameless Nie’s entire body melted into the night. His black robes covered all of him, his face indistinguishable.</p><p>In Tianshui City:</p><p>It felt as if the black-robed man was an Asura who traversed through the abyss, his darkness so oppressive it made it hard to breathe.</p><p>The next day, the current president of the Arbitration Council was assassinated, and the killer left no evidence behind.</p><p class="ql-align-center"><br></p><p>The day after that, the head of the department responsible for encircling and annihilating the Rose of Death was assassinated.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly, trepidation grasped every resident of Tianshui City. The Arbitration Council spared no efforts in searching for traces of the culprit, but it proved futile. The assassin never appeared again as if they vanished into thin air.</p><p>At the headquarters of the Martial Arts Union:</p><p>The black-robed man looked at the elderly man under his feet. He just needed to apply a little force and he would crush the elderly man’s organs.</p><p>However, for some reason, the black-robed man didn’t do that. Instead, he kicked the elderly man into the air before shrinking back into the darkness and disappearing.</p><p>“From now on, I am a demon with his wings cut off. I walk in this world solely for revenge!”</p><p>——Nameless Nie</p><p>…</p><p>Many years later:</p><p><br></p><p>In the hospital:</p><p>“Ling Miao, Worriless got married. Her husband is Lord Asura and is super rich. She actually made us wear cartoon costumes…”</p><p>Nameless Nie’s face was brimming with gentleness as he looked at Ling Miao in the hospital bed and gently described things to her.</p><p>“When we get married, let’s also make them wear cartoon costumes.” Nameless Nie lightly clasped Ling Miao’s hand. “But when will you finally wake up…? I’m too lonely…”</p><p>Suddenly, Nameless Nie’s phone started ringing.</p><p>“Captain, hurry over here! There’s a big job! I guarantee you won’t believe how high the salary is! Hurry hurry hurry!” Spray of Flowers hastily said.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Nameless Nie hung up and patted Ling Miao’s forehead.</p><p>After Nameless Nie left, in the empty hospital room shielded from sight, the girl’s eyelashes twitched minutely.</p><p>If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know &lt; report chapter &gt; so we can fix it as soon as possible.</p>
